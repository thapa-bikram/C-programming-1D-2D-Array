int array[2][2];
While initializing an array it is necessary to mention the second (column) dimension, whereas the first dimension is optional.

Correct
int arr [2][3];
int arr [ ][3];

Incorrect
int arr [2][ ];
int arr [ ][ ];

We can supply value to the array by ;
arr [0][1] = 1;
arr [1][1] = 2;

There another way of visualizing Array , we can consider 2d array as an Array inside of Array.

arr [2][2] ={{1,2},{3,2}}; 

Each row is an 1d array in itself.

arr[2][4] , first 2 memory locations are created then the first between 2 is divided into 4 memory locations and same goes for the second part . 20:32
